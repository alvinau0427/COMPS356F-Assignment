                                    Essence is the world’s first stock market for things – a live ‘bid/ask’ marketplace. Buyers place bids, sellers place asks and when a bid and ask meet,
                                    and the transaction happens automatically. Retro sneakers, boots, oxfords and more – now 100% authentic guaranteed.
                                <br><br/>

                                <!-- First Question -->

                                    <span>Like Black Sheep said “the choice is yours...</span>

                                    There are two ways to buy all the things you love on Essence. For those truly committed to copping, simply click “Buy Now” on the product page to purchase the item immediately at the lowest Ask.
                                    You can pay using all major credit cards or PayPal.
                                    <br><br/>
                                    If you’re someone packed with patience, you can go the alternate route by clicking “Place a Bid.” This allows you to fire off a digital beacon to Essence sellers using a price of your choosing.
                                    When your Bid meets an Ask price that matches, the transaction happens automatically.
                                </p>
                                
                                <!-- Second Question -->
                                <blockquote>
                                    <h6><i class = "fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden = "true"></i> How do I sell on Essence ?</h6>
                                    <span>We’re all about giving our sellers choices to make things easy for you...</span>
                                </blockquote>

                                    Whether your item feels like an exploding cryptocurrency or more like a vintage Bordeaux, we have selling options for you. 
                                    <br><br/>
                                    On Essence, sellers can either sell their sneakers, watch, handbag, or streetwear item in one of two ways. Either they can “Sell Now”, by accepting the highest active bid,
                                    in which case the sale will go through at that price; or they can “Place an Ask” to create a listing at their own designated price.
                                    If and when a buyer’s Bid matches the price of the listed Ask, the transaction will automatically go through.
